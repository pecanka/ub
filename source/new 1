Particularly for the duration of 12 months, applicable from day one, even during the probation period, and formulated as vaguely as "You shall not... Compete with the business of the Employer".Â 
which is why I do not object to the stipulations about poaching clients and employees and negatively influencing contractual arrangements to the detriment of Phastar. Nor do I in fact have intentions to compete with Phastar. 

However, the wording as it stands seems excessive and I suggest the following modifications: 1. exclude the probation period from applicability of the clause; 2. reduce the covenant's duration to 6 months post termination instead of 12 months; 3. leave out the vague phrase "Compete with the business of the Employer" and only leave the parts about client/employee poaching. Can this be arranged?
